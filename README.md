# Prevent-Thievery-AI-Game
There is an agent that is trained with q-learning, in a grid world there is a chest and a key, and the agent needs to get the key first and then go to the chest. If agent tries to go the chest first without a key, the chest will not be open and agent will not be able to get the diamond.After agent gets the diamond, the game ends. In this grid world, there will be spikes that kill the agent, there will be holes that also kill the agent if it falls into a one. Spike's punishment will be -30, hole's punishment will be -50. Gridworld will be 10x10(this may change). There will be a guard that chases the agent. If the agent is caught by the guard game is over, and the punishment for the getting caught by a guard is -100. The guard will chase the agent with A* algorithm without stepping on the holes and spikes. Every empty step cost -0.1 reward. The agent's aim is to collect the diamond in the chest without being caught by the guard and dont step on spikes and holes. For every iteration the agent iterates, agent saves the experience in the gridworld for the agent. When the agent fails and starts the game again, it remembers the previous experiences. This experience is stored in a json file. This project is done with pygame library. The game will have three kind of maps. First one is easy, second is moderate and the third one is hard. Logic is more difficult the map is the more traps and holes there are.
